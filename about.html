    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Hungarian–German advisor and writer working at the intersection of architecture,
      interior culture, and strategic communication. My work is shaped by a Central European
      background and a long-standing interest in how spaces, institutions, and language
      structure social life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live and work primarily in Leipzig, with professional ties across Germany,
      France, Switzerland, and Austria.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I studied cultural and communication sciences in Budapest, with a focus on European
      cultural history and institutional contexts, and completed postgraduate coursework
      in Paris at the École des Hautes Études, concentrating on elite communication,
      governance, and transnational cultural networks.

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2020, I have worked independently as an advisor on strategic positioning,
      narrative development, and discreet communication. My clients include family-owned
      businesses, private individuals, and cultural or philanthropic organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engagements are typically long-term and advisory in nature, often connected to
      questions of legacy, spatial representation, and public or semi-public presence.
